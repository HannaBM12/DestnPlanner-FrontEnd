Project Name: Destination Planner.

Project Overview: This is my Final Capstone project at Flatiron School. It was designed to help travelers arrange their hotel and tour reservations at their destinations. I got inspired to build this app from my previous work experience. I used to work in airline industry and assisted passengers with their flight, hotel and tour accommodation.

To build this app I used rails for the backend and react for the frontend. In addition I used Rapid API to seed my database and bring real time hotel information in to the App, Mapbox GL to locate each hotel on a map and JWT to authenticate each user. The backend is currently running on http://localhost:3000/ and the frontend on http://localhost:3006/

Dependency Files : "@material-ui/core": "^4.11.4", "@material-ui/icons": "^4.11.2", "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.4", "@testing-library/react": "^11.1.0", "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10", "bootstrap": "^4.6.0", "classnames": "^2.3.1", "react": "^17.0.2", "react-bootstrap": "^1.6.0", "react-dom": "^17.0.2", "react-map-gl": "^6.1.15", "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0", "react-scripts": "4.0.3", "react-scroll": "^1.8.2", "react-swipeable-views": "^0.14.0", "semantic-ui-css": "^2.4.1", "semantic-ui-react": "^2.0.3", "styled-components": "^5.3.0", "web-vitals": "^1.0.1"

I used react router to navigate between the pages, and when the user first land into the page, Before login/singup, he can see list of hotel information by going to hotels tab or use the search bar at the home page and search for a hotel at his/her destination.

Once the hotel is displayed he can sort by price/star rating, he can also search by hotel name/location. But to request more information about a hotel he should login/singup.

Once inside the traveler can see detail information about the hotel like, room types, nearby airports, distance from the city center, current Covid-19 measures, if pets are allowed or not, check-in/out times, amenities etc... if he decided to book there is an option for him to make reservations by submitting his check-in and out dates, no of rooms and nights. He can also submit his hotel reviews.

upon reserving a hotel he will be redirected to his reservations summary page where he can see current and past reservations. There is an option for him to cancel/update his reservations.

From this page he can also add city tour and see tour options at his current city. He can book a city tour and also cancel his current or previous tours.

To style this App I used Sematic UI and Material UI.

This app is currently tested on IOS.
